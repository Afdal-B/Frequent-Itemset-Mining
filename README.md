# Frequent Itemset Mining

This project implements the Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. 
It includes functions to calculate support counts, identify frequent itemsets, generate candidate itemsets, and determine strong association rules.

## Features

- Compute support count of an itemset
- Identify frequent and non-frequent itemsets
- Generate candidate itemsets for the next level of enumeration
- Calculate confidence and determine strong association rules
- Test and evaluate the functions on various datasets
